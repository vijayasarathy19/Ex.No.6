 # Ex. No. 6 – Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools
 # NAME: Vijaya sarathy
 # REGISTER NUMBER: 212223080057--
## Aim
 Write and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools to automate the task of interacting
 with APIs, comparing outputs, and generating actionable insights with multiple AI tools.--
## AI Tools Required- **OpenAI GPT (ChatGPT)**- **Other AI Provider (e.g., Cohere, Anthropic, or HuggingFace models)**- **Python 3.8+**- Libraries: `requests`, `openai`, `difflib`, `json` (optionally `sentence-transformers` for semantic
 similarity)--
## Explanation
 This experiment applies the **persona pattern** where the AI acts as a *programmer persona* to solve
 a programming task.
 We send the same prompt to multiple AI providers, collect their generated code, and then compare:- **Code style** (concise vs verbose)- **Correctness** (does the code run?)- **Completeness** (includes comments, unit tests, complexity analysis)- **Similarity** (textual and semantic)
 This enables a fair evaluation of multiple AI tools on the same task.--
## Procedure
 1. **Define a Scenario:**
 Example — Implement a Python function `merge_sorted_lists(a, b)` that merges two sorted lists, include
 unit tests and complexity analysis.
 2. **Use Persona Pattern:**
 Prompt the models with:
 *"Act as an experienced Python programmer. Write clean, optimized code for merging two sorted lists with
 explanation and complexity analysis."*
 3. **Collect Responses:**- Query OpenAI GPT model using `openai` library- Query another AI provider through its REST API
 4. **Compare Outputs:**- Measure **difflib similarity ratio**- Count number of words/characters- Optionally compute semantic similarity using embeddings
 5. **Generate Insights:**

 Editing Ex.No.6/README.md at main · Dhayananth-P-S/Ex.No.6- Identify which model provided better explanation and correct code- Detect missing parts or improvements
 6. **Store Results:**
 Save as `results.json` or print a tabular summary--
## Sample Python Code
 ```python
 import os, difflib, json, requests
 import openai
 openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
 # Prompt with persona pattern
 prompt = (
 "Act as an experienced Python programmer. "
 "Write a function merge_sorted_lists(a, b) that merges two sorted lists and returns the result. "
 "Include a short explanation and time complexity."
 )
 # OpenAI response
 response_openai = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
 model="gpt-4o",
 messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
 max_tokens=400,
 temperature=0.2
 )
 openai_text = response_openai.choices[0].message.content
 # Example second provider (dummy endpoint)
 second_provider_endpoint = "https://api.example.com/generate"
 headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('ANOTHER_API_KEY')}"}
 payload = {"prompt": prompt, "max_tokens": 400}
 resp2 = requests.post(second_provider_endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)
 provider2_text = resp2.json().get("text", "")
 # Compare using difflib
 similarity = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, openai_text, provider2_text).ratio()
 # Save results
 results = {
 "prompt": prompt,
 "openai_response": openai_text,
 "provider2_response": provider2_text,
 "similarity_score": similarity
 }
 with open("results.json", "w") as f:
 json.dump(results, f, indent=2)
 print(f"Similarity Score: {similarity:.2f}")
 print("Comparison saved to results.json")

 This experiment successfully demonstrates how to build Python code that integrates with multiple AI
 tools, compares their results, and extracts actionable insights.
 Such a system can be reused for **AI evaluation, research, or prompt testing** in real-world projects.--
## Result
 Thus, the Python code integrating multiple AI tools was developed, executed, and verified successfully.
 The outputs from different providers were compared, analyzed, and summarized effectively.
